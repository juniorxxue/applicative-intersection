# Applicative Intersection Types

[stlc.ott](stlc.ott): typesetting file, no updates for long time

[applicative-subtyping.txt](applicative-subtyping.txt): original specificaltion and motivation

[applicative-intersection](applicative-intersection): proof of original

[applicative-intersection-semantics](https://github.com/juniorxxue/applicative-intersection-semantics): spec with git history and proto code with PLT redex

[applicative-intersection-nodir](applicative-intersection-nodir): drop bidirectional typing

[applicative-intersection-value-abs](applicative-intersection-value-abs): take unannotated lambda as value: pvr structure

[applicative-intersection-value-abs-lambda-rule](applicative-intersection-value-abs-lambda-rule): with some adapations of lambda rule with previous one

[applicative-intersection-no-unlam](applicative-intersection-no-unlam): drop unannotated lambda to startup a trivial system

[applicative-intersection-no-unlam-distri-merge](applicative-intersection-no-unlam-distri-merge): add functionality of distirbuting in typing and semantics

[applicative-intersection-new-appsub](applicative-intersection-new-appsub): follow up with full-blown application subtyping

[applicative-intersection-new-appsub-no-distri](applicative-intersection-new-appsub-no-distri): new appsub without distributivity

[applicative-intersection-new-appsub-distri](applicative-intersection-new-appsub-distri): system with bcd distributivity

[applicative-intersection-no-typing-stack](applicative-intersection-no-typing-stack): system with bcd distributivity, but without stack on typing

[applicative-intersection-restricted-value](applicative-intersection-restricted-value): followed, but anno in value cannot be and type

[applicative-intersection-split-appsub](applicative-intersection-split-appsub): followed, but appsub on splittable types
