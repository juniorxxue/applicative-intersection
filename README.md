# Applicative Intersection Types
type systems for applicative intersection types

`stlc.ott`: typesetting file, no updates for long time

`applicative-subtyping.txt`: original specificaltion and motivation

`/applicative-intersection`: proof of original

`/applicative-intersection-semantics`: spec with git history and proto code with PLT redex

`/applicative-intersection-nodir`: drop bidirectional typing

`/applicative-intersection-value-abs`: take unannotated lambda as value: pvr structure

`/applicative-intersection-value-abs-lambda-rule`: with some adapations of lambda rule with previous one

`/applicative-intersection-no-unlam`: drop unannotated lambda to startup a trivial system

`/applicative-intersection-no-unlam-distri-merge`: add functionality of distirbuting in typing and semantics
